Social Media Platform (MERN Stack)
Project Overview
This is a full-stack social media application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. The platform is designed to provide a modern and interactive user experience, allowing individuals to connect, share posts, and engage with content. It serves as a strong demonstration of building a complete, responsive, and data-driven web application from the ground up.

Key Features
User Authentication: Secure user registration and login functionality using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for a protected API.

Dynamic User Profiles: Each user has a unique profile page where they can view their posts, manage their follower/following lists, and update their profile picture and bio.

Image-Based Posts: Users can create and upload new posts that include an image and a text caption.

Interactive Feed: The home page displays a feed of posts from all users, with options to like, comment, and follow the post's author directly from the feed.

Following System: A robust follow/unfollow system allows users to curate their feed and connect with others.

Responsive Design: The application's UI is optimized for a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Technology Stack
This project leverages a powerful and popular stack for modern web development.

Frontend
React.js: A declarative and component-based library for building the user interface.

React Router: Manages client-side routing to create a single-page application experience.

Axios: A promise-based HTTP client used to make API calls to the backend.

HTML5 & CSS3: Core languages for structuring and styling the application, with a focus on modern, clean design.

Backend
Node.js: The JavaScript runtime environment that powers the server.

Express.js: A fast and minimalist web framework for building the RESTful API endpoints.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Used for secure, stateless authentication.

Database
MongoDB: A flexible NoSQL database used to store all application data, including users, posts, and comments.
